## Basic flow of the forms
Just like we use Model/Controller/View in default Laravel, we use a similar setup here.

* The Form file can be compared to a Model, where you define the fields and behaviour of a form.
* The FormController is a bit like a Controller, where the magic happens to get everything shown/pushed in the frontend.

These are the steps a view will take when you add a form to it:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
